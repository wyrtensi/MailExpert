//
// The folder integrity check counts a UID as missing when the server reports it and we have
// no row for it. That is correct, except when the server will never produce the message: it
// schedules a backfill, the backfill asks for exactly those UIDs, nothing comes back, and
// the next pass finds the same gap. A production iCloud account ran that loop 35 times in
// five hours over the same five UIDs, and would have run it forever.
//
// These are not phantom SEARCH results. The integrity check throws if SEARCH and the flag
// FETCH disagree, so the server is consistent that they exist; it just cannot return them.
//
// So: count how many times each UID has been asked for and refused, and once that passes a
// threshold, stop counting it as missing. Give up on the message, not on the mailbox.

// One miss is not enough. A batch can come back short because a connection dropped mid-fetch
// or the server was busy, and writing those off after a single attempt would quietly abandon
// retrievable mail. Three consecutive refusals is a server that means it.
