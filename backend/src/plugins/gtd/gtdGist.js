// AI-condensed one-line gist for GTD "waiting" entries. The client shows the raw
// message snippet by default; when a gist has been generated for a waiting thread's
// head it is shown instead. Generation is lazy and bounded:
//
//   - triggered only by a sections fetch that returns waiting heads lacking a gist,
//     and only when an AI provider is configured (never at ingest — cost control);
//   - at most GIST_CONCURRENCY AI calls in flight per account, capped per invocation;
//   - one gtd_sections_updated broadcast per account once its batch writes ≥1 gist,
//     so clients receive the gist on the next refetch with no spinner.
//
// The prompt-building / output-sanitising / provider mechanics now live in the generic
// `summarize` capability (summarizeMessage/summarizeAvailable); this module keeps only the
// GTD-specific orchestration — which states carry a gist, the gtd_gist column, the bounded
// per-account batch, and the section-refresh broadcast.
