// DB-first moves. A user's move, archive, delete to Trash or spam/not-spam changes the panel's
// database at once and answers the request; the MOVE on the mail server runs later, from a
// durable queue (migration 0075, table message_moves), in the background. The panel database is
// the source of truth for the people using it, so a busy mailbox no longer turns a move into a
// "mailbox busy, try again" error. Flag changes work the same way (the flag-push queue).
//
// Life of a moved row (UIDPLUS server, the normal case):
//   1. The route enqueues: one message_moves row (id n) holding where the letter is on the server
//      (src_folder, src_uid) and where it goes (dest_folder). In the same statement the message
//      row moves to dest_folder with the placeholder uid -n. The row keeps its id, so the client
//      and every later action address the same row. Placeholders are negative, so they never
//      collide with a server UID in UNIQUE(account_id, uid, folder).
//   2. While the move is pending, (account, src_folder, src_uid) and (account, dest_folder, -n)
//      are guarded (ImapManager._guardMoveUid): reconcileDeletes and the integrity pass do not
//      delete either, and sync and backfill do not insert the letter at the source again.
//   3. The worker claims the account's queued moves, groups them by (source, destination) and
//      sends one MOVE per group, after any flag store already called on those letters
//      (ImapManager.flagStoresSettled). The server names the new uid U (COPYUID), and the row
//      takes it (settle). A destination sync that sees the letter first attaches it to the row
//      instead of inserting a second one (claimArrival), and the settle then has nothing to do.
//   4. A read or star change made while the move is pending is stored on the queue row
//      (deferFlags) and written at (dest_folder, U) after the MOVE.
// A server that names no new uid leaves the move awaiting_uid: the destination sync attaches the
// letter by its Message-ID, or the worker looks it up. A letter moved again while its move is in
// flight gets a second move whose source uid is filled in when the first one settles.
//
// Failures: one that may pass (the server did not move a letter it still has, a dropped
// connection) is retried with backoff; a busy pool or a login held back by the account's
// backoffs (#98, #99, #102) is not counted as an attempt. A permanent one (the letter is gone
// from the source, the destination folder is gone) or MOVE_MAX_ATTEMPTS failures return the row
// to its source folder and uid and tell every client (move_reverted).
