// Broadcast gtd_sections_updated for an account IFF an ordinary mail mutation touched a

// server's fingerprint moves, so a change MailExpert itself wrote to the DB (archive,
// delete, move, snooze, spam/ham, read, star) never trips it and the data can lag a full
// tick behind. A mutation is "relevant" when either of two things is true:
//   1. One of the acted messages still shares its RFC Message-ID with a live row in one
//      of the account's designated GTD label folders — i.e. the thread has (or is) a
//      classify sibling. `messageIds` are RFC Message-IDs (not row PKs) so this survives
//      the acted row being moved/deleted by the mutation.
//   2. One of the acted rows' PRE-mutation folders (`actedFolders`) was itself a
//      designated GTD folder. This covers a mutation that removes the last GTD-folder
//      copy of a thread: the post-mutation EXISTS below finds nothing (no sibling is
//      left), but the thread was present in GTD section data and clients still need a refresh.
//
// #2 is a pure in-memory check against the cached config, so it adds no query. #1 is a
// single indexed EXISTS, so a mutation on a non-GTD thread with no pre-mutation GTD folder
// emits nothing; a GTD-disabled account skips both checks entirely (getGtdConfig is
// cached). One broadcast per call regardless of how many messages qualified. imapManager
// is injected (like the transition engine) so this stays unit-testable without a live
// socket server.
