  // Attempt 0 of setFlag: store the flag on the account's persistent IDLE session, the way

  // A mark-read or star then costs no login at all, where the pool costs a pooled session or a
  // fresh login. ImapFlow breaks IDLE before any command (run() awaits preCheck, which sends
  // DONE) and re-arms auto-IDLE when the command ends and the lock is released, so the session
  // is back in IDLE AUTO_IDLE_DELAY_MS after the last store. A burst of stores within that
  // delay shares one DONE and one IDLE, which also keeps a hibernated Dovecot session on the
  // mail node from being woken more than once per burst. Returns true when the flag was
  // applied, false when the caller must use the pool.
  //
  // Deliberately narrow:
  //  - INBOX only. The push session has INBOX selected; selecting another folder on it would
  //    silence INBOX EXISTS events for that window.
  //  - Not while this account syncs or connects. syncMessages holds this session's INBOX lock
  //    for the whole sync and applies inbox rules inside it, so a store from a rule would wait
  //    for a lock its own caller holds. The initial sync runs under connectingAccounts, before
  //    syncingAccounts is ever set. syncMessages also marks the client while it holds the
  //    lock (syncLockedClients), which covers a sync still running after its caller gave up.
  //  - Bounded. A timeout falls through to the pool rather than hanging the click. The attempt
  //    keeps running detached; if its lock arrives after we gave up it releases at once and
  //    stores nothing, so the lock cannot leak and the store is not sent twice.
  //  - .SILENT. Without it the server answers with an untagged FETCH (FLAGS) that ImapFlow emits
  //    as a 'flags' event, and _attachIdleListeners answers that with a range flag sync on the
  //    pool: our own mark-read would buy a pooled session after all.
  //  - A failure here never tears the persistent client down. A failed STORE is not evidence
  //    the session is dead; the sync tick and the health check own that decision.
  //  - Skipped while an attempt we gave up on is still pending on this session. A half-open
  //    socket keeps `usable` true: DONE goes out, the STORE is never answered, and the attempt
  //    holds the INBOX lock. Without the skip every INBOX click on the account would queue
  //    behind it, wait out the deadline, and only then use the pool. The skip ends when the
  //    attempt settles, which a close() of the client guarantees (it rejects every request).
