// Whether to render an unread badge, and what it should say.
//
// A badge is an attention indicator, not a data field: absence means "nothing to tell you".
// Staleness therefore ANNOTATES a badge that already exists for a real reason and must never
// create one. The four sidebar call sites previously each carried their own copy of
// `count > 0 || stale`, so a folder or account with zero unread grew a ghost badge every time
// its observation aged past STATUS_STALE_MS and lost it again on the next observation. On the
// collapsed sidebar that badge is a bare accent dot, visually identical to new mail arriving.
//
// An unknown count also renders nothing. "Unknown is not zero" governs how a count is
// DISPLAYED (see the message-list header, which is a data field and shows an em dash), not
// whether an indicator appears. Inventing an indicator for a value we do not have is the same
// false signal in the other direction.
//
// One helper rather than four inline conditions, so the invariant has a single home and a test.
