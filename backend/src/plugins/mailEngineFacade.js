// Bounded mail-engine facade handed to plugin hooks (v3.0 plugin platform).
//
// The import boundary (eslint.plugins-boundary + api.js) stops a plugin from importing the mail
// engine, but core still *hands* engine references to plugin hooks at runtime — via the hook ctx
// (ctx.mgr / ctx.imapManager) and the sync-tick descriptor. Passing the real ImapManager there
// would give a plugin the whole engine: disconnectAccount, the live authenticated IMAP clients held
// in `connections`, the shared on-demand sync-lock set, and more. Instead core wraps the engine in
// this frozen facade exposing ONLY the narrow, reviewed sync/label primitives a hook legitimately
// needs. This is the runtime twin of the import boundary: together they mean a plugin reaches the
// engine by neither import nor ctx.
//
// Every method delegates 1:1 to the engine with identical semantics. The two state-bearing members
// (`connections`, `onDemandSyncing`) are narrowed to methods so a plugin can query/coordinate but
// can never read another account's connection object or corrupt core's lock set. The surface is the
// exact union of what the in-repo GTD plugin uses; it grows only as new primitives are reviewed.
