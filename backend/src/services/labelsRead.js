// Generic thread-aware "labels" READ capability (v3.0 plugin platform).
//
// Given a set of label folders for one account, return the thread HEADS grouped by label,
// with per-label total/unread counts and a deduped union rollup. Everything correctness-
// critical about reading labels lives here so features — and, later, sandboxed plugins —
// never run raw SQL:
//   • the head prefers the (often older) label-folder copy so its id is stable for as long
//     as the thread is in a section (a transient INBOX copy could be archived out from under
//     the feed, leaving the client deep-linking to a since-deleted id);
//   • "unread" is THREAD-LEVEL — a thread is unread while ANY of its non-deleted, non-draft
//     copies is unread, so a read label-folder head can't mask an unread INBOX-only reply;
//   • `in_inbox` / `folders` expose the full cross-folder picture (archived-but-labelled vs
//     still-in-box);
//   • the union rollup deduplicates a thread that carries two of the union labels.
//
// GTD is the first consumer — its states (Todo/Watch/Delegated/…) are just labels whose
// folders come from its own config. The `state` column in the result is the label identifier
// (named for that first consumer). Per-account only: a thread spanning accounts is counted
// independently per account (the caller merges/dedupes across accounts).
//
// Params: $1 accountId, $2 label names[], $3 label folder paths[] (parallel to $2),
//         $4 draft folder paths[] (excluded), $5 per-label limit,
//         $6 union label names[] (the subset of $2 rolled up into one deduped count).

// Generic "did a mail mutation touch a labelled thread?" notify capability (v3.0 plugin

// server's fingerprint moves — so a label-driven feed can lag a full tick behind. This lets a
// feature (and, later, a sandboxed plugin) ask core to broadcast a refresh event to every
// client IFF the mutation was relevant to its labels. Relevance is either:
//   1. one of the acted messages still shares its RFC Message-ID with a live row in one of the
//      label folders (the thread has, or is, a label copy) — `messageIds` are RFC Message-IDs
//      (not row PKs) so this survives the acted row being moved/deleted by the mutation; or
//   2. one of the acted rows' PRE-mutation folders was itself a label folder — covers a
//      mutation that removes the last label copy of a thread, where #1 finds nothing.
// #2 is a pure in-memory check (no query). #1 is one indexed EXISTS. `event` is the broadcast
// type; mailboxes are shared, so the event goes to every client. imapManager
// is injected so this stays unit-testable without a live socket server. Returns whether it
// broadcast.
